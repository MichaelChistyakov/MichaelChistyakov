### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In addition to my portfolio I also have 10+ years of experience with animations and effects. In the course of the years JavaScript became my genuine passion, so I'm well aware of web animations and able to create dozens of challenging technical solutions myself.

Look through my stack:

- THREE.js / PIXI.js
- WebGL shaders
- Pure JS
- GSAP products (TweenMax, Draggable etc.)
- jQuery
- Canvas 2D / 3D
- History API, DeviceOrientation API,
- Deep understanding of modern possibilities of web dev.

Today I'm a co-founder and a part of Sborka Project Team, where we are dealing with front-end development and competitive websites. Check out here: https://sborkaproject.com/
