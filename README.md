### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In addition to my portfolio I also have 10+ years of experience with animations and effects. In the course of the years a Senior JavaScript became my genuine passion, so I'm well aware of web animations and able to create dozens of challenging technical solutions myself.

Look through my stack:

- THREE.js / PIXI.js
- WebGL shaders
- React.js
- Redux
- Pure JS
- GSAP products (TweenMax, Draggable etc.)
- jQuery
- Canvas 2D / 3D
- History API, DeviceOrientation API,
- Deep understanding of modern possibilities of web dev.

Today I'm a co-founder and a part of Sborka Project Team, where we are dealing with front-end development and competitive websites. Check out here: sborkaproject.com
